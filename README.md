### 💡 About Me


As a **proficient Software Developer** 💻, I look forward to the challenges that high-quality, performant applications present. To this end, I leverage **Next.js**, **React.js**, and most importantly, **Tailwind CSS** ✨, to create sleek and responsive UI experiences. I design scalable and performant backends with **Spring Boot** and **Express.js** ⚡. My passion for mobile development involves building mobile apps with **React Native** 📱, enabling cross-platform development. Besides writing code, I'm an **enthusiastic robotics** nerd 🤖 with a keen interest in software and automation innovation.
